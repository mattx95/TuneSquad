# TuneSquad
TechCrunch Disrupt London Hackathon 2015

TuneSquad reimagines the way that friends listen and share music together. TuneSquad is an Android Application that lets groups listen to the same music at the same time, each in his/her own headphones (like old-school headphone splitters) while taking turns queueing songs to create dynamic playlists together. It uses the Humm Music API to source content.
